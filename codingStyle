 * Contents of this file should be the base for .h source file, except function
 * body at the end.
 *
 * ###Style
 *  - Style is based on Linux style
 *  - Indent size is 4.
 *  - Spaces are used, not tabs.
 *  - More datails are defined in .clang-format file
 *  - Some (old) code is still not corectly formatted. (To not break git history.)
 *
 * ###Doxygen
 * Documentation is generated by doxygen.
 * Doxygen comment starts with /**. /**< is used after member.
 * Documentation is usually in header.
 * Doxygen settings:
 *  - JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF = YES.
 *  - See doxyfile for other settings.
 *
 * Doxygen specifics: If description of the structure member is one sentence
 * only, don't use period after the sentence.
