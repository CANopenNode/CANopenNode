 * CANopenNode runs on top of SocketCAN interface, which is part of the Linux
 * kernel. For more info on Linux SocketCAN see
 * https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/can.html
 *
 * CANopenNode runs in two threads:
 * - timer based real-time thread for CAN receive, SYNC and PDO, see
 *   CANrx_threadTmr_process()
 * - mainline thread for other processing, see threadMainWait_process()
 *
 * The "threads" specified here do not fork threads themselves, but require
 * that two threads are provided by the calling application.
 *
 * Main references for Linux functions used here are Linux man pages and the
 * book: The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk.
