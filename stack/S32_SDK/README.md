For the driver to be functional you need to have installed either the S32DS: S32 Design Studio IDE for ARM or POWERPC, or the S32 SDK Standalone.
Both can be found [here](https://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers-and-processors/power-architecture-processors/mpc5xxx-55xx-32-bit-mcus/ultra-reliable-mpc57xx-32-bit-automotive-industrial-microcontrollers-mcus/s32-design-studio-ide:S32DS?fsrch=1&sr=1&pageNum=1)

The driver for CANopenNode stack was developed and tested using the S32K144EVB-Q100 device under S32DS for ARM environment with SDK S32K 0.8.5, but it should work with any of the future S32 SDK versions and supported devices. The driver is tested also on DEVKIT-MPC5748G device under S32DS for POWER Architecture environment with SDK C55 0.8.1.
