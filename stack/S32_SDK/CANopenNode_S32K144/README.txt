## Application description ##

The purpose of this demo application is to show you the usage of the CANopenNode, which is configured to work with FlexCAN module from the S32K144 CPU using the S32 SDK API.
The application simulates an air conditioning unit with a remote sensor.
It is split into two projects:
 - CANopen_Sensor_s32k144
 - CANopen_Unit_s32k144

The projects are made using S32DS for ARM
If using S32DS please copy the S32_SDK\CANopenNode_S32K144 folder into {S32DS install directory}\S32DS\Examples\ and then follow the instructions in the Documentation.pdf, How to run section.

For more details regarding this example please see Documentation.pdf, or the doxygen files in both projects.
