For the driver to be functional you need to have installed either the S32DS: S32 Design Studio IDE for ARM or POWERPC, or the S32 SDK Standalone.
Both can be found on https://www.nxp.com/

The driver for CANopenNode stack was developed and tested using the S32K144EVB-Q100 device under S32DS for ARM environment with SDK 0.8.5, but it should work with any of the future S32 SDK versions and supported devices.
