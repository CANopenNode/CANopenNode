 * @{
 *
 * Microcontroller specific code for CANopenNode.
 *
 * This file contains type definitions, functions and macros for:
 *  - Basic data types.
 *  - Receive and transmit buffers for CANopen messages.
 *  - Interaction with CAN module on the microcontroller.
 *  - CAN receive and transmit interrupts.
 *
 * This file is not only a CAN driver. There are no classic CAN queues for CAN
 * messages. This file provides direct connection with other CANopen
 * objects. It tries to provide fast responses and tries to avoid unnecessary
 * calculations and memory consumptions.
 *
 * CO_CANmodule_t contains an array of _Received message objects_ (of type
 * CO_CANrx_t) and an array of _Transmit message objects_ (of type CO_CANtx_t).
 * Each CANopen communication object owns one member in one of the arrays.
 * For example Heartbeat producer generates one CANopen transmitting object,
 * so it has reserved one member in CO_CANtx_t array.
 * SYNC module may produce sync or consume sync, so it has reserved one member
 * in CO_CANtx_t and one member in CO_CANrx_t array.
 *
 * ###Reception of CAN messages.
 * Before CAN messages can be received, each member in CO_CANrx_t must be
 * initialized. CO_CANrxBufferInit() is called by CANopen module, which
 * uses specific member. For example @ref CO_HBconsumer uses multiple members
 * in CO_CANrx_t array. (It monitors multiple heartbeat messages from remote
 * nodes.) It must call CO_CANrxBufferInit() multiple times.
 *
 * Main arguments to the CO_CANrxBufferInit() function are CAN identifier
 * and a pointer to callback function. Those two arguments (and some others)
 * are copied to the member of the CO_CANrx_t array.
 *
 * Callback function is a function, specified by specific CANopen module
 * (for example by @ref CO_HBconsumer). Each CANopen module defines own
 * callback function. Callback function will process the received CAN message.
 * It will copy the necessary data from CAN message to proper place. It may
 * also trigger additional task, which will further process the received message.
 * Callback function must be fast and must only make the necessary calculations
 * and copying.
 *
 * Received CAN messages are processed by CAN receive interrupt function.
 * After CAN message is received, function first tries to find matching CAN
 * identifier from CO_CANrx_t array. If found, then a corresponding callback
 * function is called.
 *
 * Callback function accepts two parameters:
 *  - object is pointer to object registered by CO_CANrxBufferInit().
 *  - msg  is pointer to CAN message of type CO_CANrxMsg_t.
 *
 * Callback function must return #CO_ReturnError_t: CO_ERROR_NO,
 * CO_ERROR_RX_OVERFLOW, CO_ERROR_RX_PDO_OVERFLOW, CO_ERROR_RX_MSG_LENGTH or
 * CO_ERROR_RX_PDO_LENGTH.
 *
 *
 * ###Transmission of CAN messages.
 * Before CAN messages can be transmitted, each member in CO_CANtx_t must be
 * initialized. CO_CANtxBufferInit() is called by CANopen module, which
 * uses specific member. For example Heartbeat producer must initialize it's
 * member in CO_CANtx_t array.
 *
 * CO_CANtxBufferInit() returns a pointer of type CO_CANtx_t, which contains buffer
 * where CAN message data can be written. CAN message is send with calling
 * CO_CANsend() function. If at that moment CAN transmit buffer inside
 * microcontroller's CAN module is free, message is copied directly to CAN module.
 * Otherwise CO_CANsend() function sets _bufferFull_ flag to true. Message will be
 * then sent by CAN TX interrupt as soon as CAN module is freed. Until message is
 * not copied to CAN module, its contents must not change. There may be multiple
 * _bufferFull_ flags in CO_CANtx_t array set to true. In that case messages with
 * lower index inside array will be sent first.

/**
 * @name Critical sections
 * CANopenNode is designed to run in different threads, as described in README.
 * Threads are implemented differently in different systems. In microcontrollers
 * threads are interrupts with different priorities, for example.
 * It is necessary to protect sections, where different threads access to the
 * same resource. In simple systems interrupts or scheduler may be temporary
 * disabled between access to the shared resource. Otherwise mutexes or
 * semaphores can be used.
 *
 * ####Reentrant functions.
 * Functions CO_CANsend() from C_driver.h, CO_errorReport() from CO_Emergency.h
 * and CO_errorReset() from CO_Emergency.h may be called from different threads.
 * Critical sections must be protected. Eather by disabling scheduler or
 * interrupts or by mutexes or semaphores.
 *
 * ####Object Dictionary variables.
 * In general, there are two threads, which accesses OD variables: mainline and
 * timer. CANopenNode initialization and SDO server runs in mainline. PDOs runs
 * in faster timer thread. Processing of PDOs must not be interrupted by
 * mainline. Mainline thread must protect sections, which accesses the same OD
 * variables as timer thread. This care must also take the application. Note
 * that not all variables are allowed to be mapped to PDOs, so they may not need
 * to be protected. SDO server protects sections with access to OD variables.
 *
 * ####CAN receive thread.
 * It partially processes received CAN data and puts them into appropriate
 * objects. Objects are later processed. It does not need protection of
 * critical sections. There is one circumstance, where CANrx should be disabled:
 * After presence of SYNC message on CANopen bus, CANrx should be temporary
 * disabled until all receive PDOs are processed. See also CO_SYNC.h file and
 * CO_SYNC_initCallback() function.
