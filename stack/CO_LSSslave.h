 *
 * CANopen Layer Setting Service - server protocol
 *
 * The server/slave provides the following services
 * - node selection via LSS address
 * - node selection via LSS fastscan
 * - Inquire LSS address of currently selected node
 * - Inquire node ID
 * - Configure bit timing
 * - Configure node ID
 * - Activate bit timing parameters
 * - Store configuration (bit rate and node ID)
 *
 * After CAN module start, the LSS server and NMT server are started and then
 * coexist alongside each other. To achieve this behaviour, the CANopen node
 * startup process has to be conrolled more detailled. Therefore, the function
 * CO_init() is split up into the functions #CO_new(), #CO_CANinit(), #CO_LSSinit()
 * and #CO_CANopenInit().
 * Moreover, the LSS server needs to pause the NMT server initialization in case
 * no valid node ID is available at start up.
 *
 * ###Example
 *
 * It is strongly recommended that the user already has a fully working application
 * running with the standard (non LSS) version of CANopenNode. This is required
 * to understand what this example does and where you need to change it for your
 * requirements.
 *
 * The following code is only a suggestion on how to use the LSS server. It is
 * not a working example! To simplify the code, no error handling is
 * included. For stable code, proper error handling has to be added to the user
 * code.
 *
 * This example is not intended for bare metal targets. If you intend to do CAN
 * message receiving inside interrupt, be aware that the callback functions
 * will be called inside the interrupt handler context!
