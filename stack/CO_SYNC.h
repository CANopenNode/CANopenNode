 * CANopen SYNC object protocol.
 *
 * For CAN identifier see #CO_Default_CAN_ID_t
 *
 * SYNC message is used for synchronization of the nodes on network. There is
 * one SYNC producer and zero or more SYNC consumers.
 *
 * ####Contents of SYNC message
 * By default SYNC message has no data. If _Synchronous counter overflow value_
 * from Object dictionary (index 0x1019) is different than 0, SYNC message has
 * one data byte: counter incremented by 1 with every SYNC transmission.
