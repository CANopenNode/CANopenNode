# CANopenNode driver for Teensy3 (Kinetis K20 ARM)

This driver has not been tested with PDO.

kinetis flexcan header comes from the FlexCAN library, which is public domain software (https://github.com/teachop/FlexCAN_Library)

### Example
The provided example is Arduino style but should clarify how to use the driver in your end application.  The driver itself does not depend on Arduino/Teensy/PJRC/whatever and should work fine in your native ARM application provided you set up the pins, interrupts, etc correctly as demonstrated in the example.

Have fun!
