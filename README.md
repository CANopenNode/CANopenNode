CANopenNode
===========

CANopenNode is free and open source CANopen Stack.

CANopen is the internationally standardized (EN 50325-4)
([CiA301](http://can-cia.org/standardization/technical-documents))
CAN-based higher-layer protocol for embedded control system. For more
information on CANopen see http://www.can-cia.org/

CANopenNode is written in ANSI C in object-oriented way. It runs on
different microcontrollers, as standalone application or with RTOS.
Stack includes master functionalities. For Linux implementation with
CANopen master functionalities see
https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenSocket.

Variables (communication, device, custom) are ordered in CANopen Object
Dictionary and are accessible from both: C code and from CAN network.

CANopen Features
----------------
 - NMT slave to start, stop, reset device. Simple NMT master.
 - Heartbeat producer/consumer error control.
 - PDO linking and dynamic mapping for fast exchange of process variables.
 - SDO expedited, segmented and block transfer for service access to all parameters.
 - SDO master.
 - Emergency message.
 - Sync producer/consumer.
 - Non-volatile storage.


Usage of the CANopenNode
------------------------
CANopenNode itself doesn't have complete working code for any microcontroller.
It is only the library with the stack and drivers for different
microcontrollers. It has example, which should compile on any system with
template driver (drvTemplate), which actually doesn't access CAN hardware.
CANopenNode should be used as a git submodule included in a project with
specific hardware and specific application.


Documentation, support and contributions
-------------------------
Code is documented in header files. Running
[doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) in project
base folder will produce complete html documentation. Just open
CANopenNode/doc/html/index.html in browser.

Report issues on https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenNode/issues

Older and still active discussion group is on Sourceforge
http://sourceforge.net/p/canopennode/discussion/387151/

For some implementations of CANopenNode on real hardware see table below.
[CANopenSocket](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenSocket) is nice
implementation for Linux devices. It includes command line interface for
master access of the CANopen network. There is also some Getting started.

Contributions are welcome. Best way to contribute your code is to fork
a project, modify it and then send a pull request.
