CANopenNode
===========

CANopenNode is free and open source CANopen protocol stack.

CANopen is the internationally standardized (EN 50325-4)
([CiA301](http://can-cia.org/standardization/technical-documents))
CAN-based higher-layer protocol for embedded control system. For more
information on CANopen see http://www.can-cia.org/

CANopenNode is written in ANSI C in object-oriented way. It runs on
different microcontrollers, as standalone application or with RTOS.
Linux implementation with CANopen master functionalities is included.

Variables (communication, device, custom) are ordered in CANopen Object
Dictionary and are accessible from both: C code and from CANopen network.

Object dictionary editor
------------------------
Object Dictionary is one of the most important parts of CANopen. Its
implementation in CANopenNode is quite outdated and there are efforts to
rewrite it. Anyway, currently it is fully operational and works well.

To customize the Object Dictionary it is necessary to use external application:
[libedssharp](https://github.com/robincornelius/libedssharp). It can be used in
Windows or Linux with Mono.

Please note: since rearrangement in directory structure it is necessary to
manually update CO_OD.c file - it must include: `301/CO_driver.h`, `CO_OD.h` and
`301/CO_SDOserver.h`.


Device support
--------------
CANopenNode can run on many different devices. Each device (or microcontroller)
must have own interface to CANopenNode. CANopenNode can run with or without
operating system.

It is not practical to have all device interfaces in a single project. For that
reason CANopenNode project only includes interface to Linux socketCAN.
Interfaces to other microcontrollers are in separate projects. See
[deviceSupport.md](doc/deviceSupport.md) for list of known device interfaces.


Some details
------------
### RTR
RTR (remote transmission request) is a feature of CAN bus. Usage of RTR
is not recommended for CANopen and it is not implemented in CANopenNode.

### Self start
Object **0x1F80** from Object Dictionary enables the NMT slaves to start
automatically or allows it to start the whole network. It is specified in
DSP302-2 standard. Standard allows two values for slaves for object 0x1F80:
- Object 0x1F80, value = **0x8** - "NMT slave shall enter the NMT state
  Operational after the NMT state Initialization autonomously (self starting)"
- Object 0x1F80, value = **0x2** - "NMT slave shall execute the NMT service
  start remote node with node-ID set to 0"

### Error control
When node is stated (in NMT operational state), it is allowed to send or
receive Process Data Objects (PDO). If Error Register (object 0x1001) is set,
then NMT operational state is not allowed.

### Power saving
All CANopen objects calculates next timer info for OS. Calculation is based on
various timers which expire in known time. Can be used to put microcontroller
into sleep and wake at the calculated time.
