CANopenNode
===========

CANopenNode is free and open source CANopen protocol stack.

CANopen is the internationally standardized (EN 50325-4) ([CiA301](http://can-cia.org/standardization/technical-documents)) higher-layer protocol for embedded control system built on top of CAN. For more information on CANopen see http://www.can-cia.org/

CANopenNode is written in ANSI C in object-oriented way. It runs on different microcontrollers, as standalone application or with RTOS.

Variables (communication, device, custom) are collected in CANopen Object Dictionary and are accessible from both: C code and from CANopen network.

CANopenNode homepage is https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenNode

This is version 4 of CANopenNode with new Object Dictionary implementation. For older versions `git checkout` branches `v1.3-master` or `v2.0-master`.


Characteristics
---------------
### CANopen
 - [Object Dictionary](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/device-architecture/) offers clear and flexible organisation of any variables. Variables can be accessed directly or via read/write functions.
 - [NMT](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/network-management/) slave to start, stop, reset device. Simple NMT master.
 - [Heartbeat](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/error-control-protocols/) producer/consumer error control for monitoring of CANopen devices.
 - [PDO](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/pdo-protocol/) for broadcasting process data with high priority and no protocol overhead. Variables from Object Dictionary can be dynamically mapped to the TPDO, which is then transmitted according to communication rules and received as RPDO by another device.
 - [SDO](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/sdo-protocol/) server enables expedited, segmented and block transfer access to all Object Dictionary variables inside CANopen device.
 - [SDO](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/sdo-protocol/) client can access any Object Dictionary variable on any CANopen device inside the network.
 - [Emergency](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/special-function-protocols/) message producer/consumer.
 - [Sync](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/special-function-protocols/) producer/consumer enables network synchronized transmission of the PDO objects, etc.
 - [Time-stamp](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/special-function-protocols/) producer/consumer enables date and time synchronization in millisecond resolution.
 - [LSS](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/cia305/) CANopen node-id and bitrate setup, master and slave, LSS fastscan.
 - [CANopen gateway](https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/canopen/cia309/), CiA309-3 Ascii command interface for NMT master, LSS master and SDO client.
 - CANopen Safety, EN 50325-5, CiA304, "PDO like" communication in safety-relevant networks

All code of the CANopenNode is non-blocking. Code in source files is collected into objects. Parts of the code can be enabled/disabled, so only files and parts of code can be used, which are required for the project. See stack configuration in 301/CO_config.h file.

For most efficiency code can run in different thread as seen in above flowchart. This is suitable for microcontrollers. It is also possible to run everything from single thread, as available on Linux devices. Code includes mechanisms, which triggers processing of OD objects when necessary.

In CANopen initialization section all CANopen objects are initialized. In run time CANopen objects are processed cyclically.

Files CANopen.h and CANopen.c is a joint of all CANopen objects. It may seems complex, but offers some flexibility and is suitable for most common configurations of the CANopen objects. CANopen objects can be defined in global space or can be dynamically allocated. Object dictionary can be used default (OD.h/.c files), but configuration with multiple object dictionaries is also possible by using the #CO_config_t structure. CANopen.h and CANopen.c files can also be only a reference for more customized implementation of CANopenNode based device.

Object Dictionary is a collection of all network accessible variables and offers most flexible usage. OD variables can be initialized by object dictionary or application can specify own read/write access functions for specific OD variables. Groups of OD variables are also able to be stored to non-volatile memory, either on command or automatically.

Object dictionary editor
------------------------
Object Dictionary is one of the most essential parts of CANopen.

To customize the Object Dictionary it is necessary to use external application: [libedssharp](https://github.com/robincornelius/libedssharp). Latest pre-compiled [binaries](https://github.com/robincornelius/libedssharp/raw/gh-pages/build/OpenEDSEditor-latest.zip) are also available. Just extract the zip file and run the `EDSEditor.exe`. In Linux it runs with mono, which is available by default on Ubuntu. Just set file permissions to "executable" and then execute the program.

In program, in preferences, set exporter to "CANopenNode_V4". Then start new project or open the existing project file.

Many project file types are supported, EDS, XDD v1.0, XDD v1.1, old custom XML format. Generated project file can then be saved in XDD v1.1 file format (xmlns="http://www.canopen.org/xml/1.1"). Project file can also be exported to other formats, it can be used to generate documentation and CANopenNode source files for Object Dictionary.

If new project was started, then `DS301_profile.xpd` may be inserted. If existing (old) project is edited, then existing `Communication Specific Parameters` may be deleted and then new `DS301_profile.xpd` may be inserted. Alternative is editing existing communication parameters with observation to Object Dictionary Requirements By CANopenNode in [objectDictionary.md](doc/objectDictionary.md).

To clone, add or delete, select object(s) and use right click. Some knowledge of CANopen is required to correctly set-up the custom Object Dictionary. Separate objects can also be inserted from another project.

CANopenNode includes some custom properties inside standard project file. See [objectDictionary.md](doc/objectDictionary.md) for more information.


Device support
--------------
CANopenNode can run on many different devices. Each device (or microcontroller) must have own interface to CANopenNode. CANopenNode can run with or without operating system.

It is not practical to have all device interfaces in a single project. Interfaces to other microcontrollers are in separate projects. See [deviceSupport.md](doc/deviceSupport.md) for list of known device interfaces.


Some details
------------
### RTR
RTR (remote transmission request) is a feature of CAN bus. Usage of RTR is not recommended for CANopen and it is not implemented in CANopenNode.

### Error control
When node is started (in NMT operational state), it is allowed to send or receive Process Data Objects (PDO). If Error Register (object 0x1001) is set, then NMT operational state may not be allowed.

### Power saving
All CANopen objects calculates next timer info for OS. Calculation is based on various timers which expire in known time. Can be used to put microcontroller into sleep and wake at the calculated time.
