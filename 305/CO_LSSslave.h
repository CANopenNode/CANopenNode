 * @{
 *
 * CANopen Layer Setting Service - slave protocol.
 *
 * The slave provides the following services
 * - node selection via LSS address
 * - node selection via LSS fastscan
 * - Inquire LSS address of currently selected node
 * - Inquire node ID
 * - Configure bit timing
 * - Configure node ID
 * - Activate bit timing parameters
 * - Store configuration (bit rate and node ID)
 *
 * After CAN module start, the LSS slave and NMT slave are started and then
 * coexist alongside each other. To achieve this behaviour, the CANopen node
 * startup process has to be controlled more detailed. Therefore, CO_LSSinit()
 * must be invoked between CO_CANinit() and CO_CANopenInit() in the
 * communication reset section.
 *
 * Moreover, the LSS slave needs to pause the NMT slave initialization in case
 * no valid node ID is available at start up. In that case CO_CANopenInit()
 * skips initialization of other CANopen modules and CO_process() skips
 * processing of other modules than LSS slave automatically.
 *
 * Variables for CAN-bitrate and CANopen node-id must be initialized by
 * application from non-volatile memory or dip switches. Pointers to them are
 * passed to CO_LSSinit() function. Those variables represents pending values.
 * If node-id is valid in the moment it enters CO_LSSinit(), it also becomes
 * active node-id and the stack initialises normally. Otherwise, node-id must be
 * configured by lss and after successful configuration stack passes reset
 * communication autonomously.
 *
 * Device with all threads can be normally initialized and running despite that
 * node-id is not valid. Application must take care, because CANopen is not
 * initialized. In that case CO_CANopenInit() returns error condition
 * CO_ERROR_NODE_ID_UNCONFIGURED_LSS which must be handled properly. Status can
 * also be checked with CO->nodeIdUnconfigured variable.
 *
 * Some callback functions may be initialized by application with
 * CO_LSSslave_initCheckBitRateCallback(),
 * CO_LSSslave_initActivateBitRateCallback() and
 * CO_LSSslave_initCfgStoreCallback().
